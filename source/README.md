### Description

Analog Devices has followed up on their popular classic, the ADXL345, with this near-drop-in-replacement, the ADXL343. Like the original, this is a triple-axis accelerometer with digital I2C and SPI interface breakout. It has a wide sensitivity range and high resolution, operating with an 10 or 13-bit internal ADC. Built-in motion detection features make tap, double-tap, activity, inactivity, and free-fall detection trivial. There's two interrupt pins, and you can map any of the interrupts independently to either of them.

The ADXL343 is nearly identical in specifications to the ADXL345, and code written for the '345 will likely work on the '343 as-is. This new accelerometer has some nice price improvements to stay within your budget.

The sensor has three axes of measurements, X Y Z, and pins that can be used either as I2C or SPI digital interfacing. You can set the sensitivity level to either +-2g, +-4g, +-8g or +-16g. The lower range gives more resolution for slow movements, the higher range is good for high speed tracking. The ADXL343 is the latest and greatest from Analog Devices, known for their exceptional quality MEMS devices.

We added an on-board 3.3V regulator and logic-level shifting circuitry, making it a perfect choice for interfacing with any 3V or 5V microcontroller or computer such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. We've got both [Arduino (C/C++)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl343-breakout-learning-guide/arduino) and [CircuitPython (Python 3](https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl343-breakout-learning-guide/circuitpython)) libraries available so you can use it with any microcontroller like [Arduino, ESP8266, Metro, etc](https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl343-breakout-learning-guide/arduino) or with [Raspberry Pi or other Linux computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl343-breakout-learning-guide/circuitpython) thanks to Blinka (our CircuitPython library support helper).

As if that weren't enough, we've also added SparkFun qwiic compatible STEMMA QT connectors for the I2C bus so you don't even need to solder. Just wire up to your favorite micro with a plug-and-play cable to get accelerometer data ASAP. For a no-solder experience, just wire up to your favorite micro using a STEMMA QT adapter cable. The Stemma QT connectors also mean the ADXL can be used with our various associated accessories. QT Cable is not included, but we have a variety in the shop

Each order comes with a fully tested and assembled breakout and some header for soldering to a PCB or breadboard. Comes with 9 pin 0.1" standard header in case you want to use it with a breadboard or perfboard. Two 2.5mm (0.1") mounting holes for easy attachment.You'll be up and running in under 5 minutes!

[Thanks to Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/) and [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html) for sponsoring the development of this breakout board - we've made the PCB "[Digi-Key red](https://www.digikey.com/)" in their honor!
